# True Fake News Detection â€“ NLP & Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to classify **fake vs. real news articles** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It includes end-to-end text preprocessing, feature extraction, visualization, and model building using various classifiers.

* **Text Preprocessing:** Cleaning, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization using NLTK
* **Feature Engineering:** Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF vectorization
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Category-wise distribution and insights
* **Modeling:** Implemented and compared Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree classifiers
* **Evaluation:** Accuracy score and classification reports for performance analysis

# Observations:

* Politics is the most frequent news category
* Fake news (label `0`) appears slightly more than real news (label `1`)
